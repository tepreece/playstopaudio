This is a simple audio library wrapper for Python. It aims to wrap various audio
libraries into an interface that gives you sound objects with methods like
"play" and "stop". The idea is that you can write your application to use these
methods, but the actual underlying library can be swapped out as audio
architectures change.

Currently it supports a few simple methods for Audiere and GStreamer; more
coming soon.

To see how it works, drop a file called "test.ogg" into this directory, and then
run "./test.py" - you can examine the source of that file for more details.
